## Testing

From version 2.3.0, Rekit starts to use jest for unit test since the boilerplate is created by create-react-app. You can see more introduction at: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests .

The only difference is Rekit save all test files under the folder `/tests` rather than along side with source files under `/src` folder.
